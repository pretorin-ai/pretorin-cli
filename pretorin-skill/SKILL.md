# Pretorin Compliance Skill

Query authoritative compliance framework data via the Pretorin MCP server. Access controls, families, document requirements, implementation guidance, STIG/CCI traceability, vendor inheritance, and campaign-based bulk workflows across NIST 800-53, NIST 800-171, FedRAMP (Low/Moderate/High), and CMMC (Level 1/2/3).

## Prerequisites

The Pretorin MCP server must be connected. If tools like `pretorin_list_frameworks` are not available, instruct the user to run:

```bash
uv tool install pretorin
pretorin login
claude mcp add --transport stdio pretorin -- pretorin mcp-serve
```

When the user says "my current system" or relies on stored CLI scope, suggest `pretorin context show --quiet --check` before assuming the local context is still valid.

## Available Frameworks

| Framework ID | Title | Controls |
|---|---|---|
| `nist-800-53-r5` | NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 | 324 |
| `nist-800-171-r3` | NIST SP 800-171 Rev 3 | 130 |
| `fedramp-low` | FedRAMP Rev 5 Low | 135 |
| `fedramp-moderate` | FedRAMP Rev 5 Moderate | 181 |
| `fedramp-high` | FedRAMP Rev 5 High | 191 |
| `cmmc-l1` | CMMC 2.0 Level 1 | 17 |
| `cmmc-l2` | CMMC 2.0 Level 2 | 110 |
| `cmmc-l3` | CMMC 2.0 Level 3 | 24 |

Always call `pretorin_list_frameworks` to get the current list rather than relying on this table.

## Control ID Formatting

Control and family IDs must be formatted correctly or the API will return errors. See `references/control-id-formats.md` for the full format guide. Key rules:

- **NIST/FedRAMP**: families are slugs (`access-control`), controls are zero-padded (`ac-01`)
- **CMMC**: families include level (`access-control-level-2`), controls are dotted (`AC.L2-3.1.1`)
- **800-171**: controls are dotted (`03.01.01`)

When unsure of an ID, discover it first with `pretorin_list_control_families` or `pretorin_list_controls`.
When the user already supplied a control ID and you have an active scope, try the exact control lookup in that active framework first. Do not silently remap the request to a different control or framework.

## Tools

### Browsing Frameworks
- **`pretorin_list_frameworks`** — List all available frameworks. No parameters. Start here when the user hasn't specified a framework.
- **`pretorin_get_framework`** — Get framework metadata and AI context (purpose, target audience, regulatory context, scope, key concepts). Pass `framework_id`.
- **`pretorin_list_control_families`** — List control families with AI context (domain summary, risk context, implementation priority). Pass `framework_id`.

### Querying Controls
- **`pretorin_list_controls`** — List controls for a framework. Pass `framework_id` and optionally `family_id` to filter by family.
- **`pretorin_get_control`** — Get full control details including AI guidance (summary, control intent, evidence expectations, implementation considerations, common failures, complexity). Pass `framework_id` and `control_id`. The `ai_guidance` field provides the richest context for generating narratives and analyzing gaps.
- **`pretorin_get_control_references`** — Get implementation guidance, objectives, and related controls. Pass `framework_id` and `control_id`. This is the most detailed view — use it to understand how to implement a control.

### Documentation
- **`pretorin_get_document_requirements`** — Get required and implied documents for a framework. Pass `framework_id`. Returns explicit (required) and implicit (control-implied) documents with their control references.

### Systems
- **`pretorin_list_systems`** — List systems in the organization. Start here when the user has not identified a target system.
- **`pretorin_get_system`** — Get system metadata including attached frameworks and security impact level. Pass a canonical `system_id` or a friendly system name.
- **`pretorin_get_compliance_status`** — Get framework progress and implementation posture for a system. Pass a canonical `system_id` or a friendly system name.

### System & Implementation Context
- **`pretorin_get_control_context`** — Get rich context for a control including AI guidance, statement, objectives, scope status, and current implementation details. Pass `system_id`, `control_id`, and `framework_id`. This is the most comprehensive view for understanding both what a control requires and how it's currently implemented.
- **`pretorin_get_scope`** — Get system scope/policy information including excluded controls and Q&A responses. Pass `system_id`. Useful for understanding what's in/out of scope before generating narratives.
- **`pretorin_get_control_implementation`** — Get implementation details including current narrative, evidence_count, and notes. Use this to read current state before writing updates.
- **`pretorin_get_narrative`** — Get the current narrative record for a control. Pass `system_id`, `control_id`, and `framework_id`.
- **`pretorin_get_control_notes`** — Get notes for a control implementation. Pass `system_id`, `control_id`, and optionally `framework_id`.
- **`pretorin_update_narrative`** — Push a narrative text update for a control implementation. Pass `system_id`, `control_id`, `framework_id`, and `narrative`. Use this after generating a narrative to save it to the platform.
- **`pretorin_create_evidence`** — Upsert evidence (find-or-create by default with `dedupe: true`) and return whether it was created or reused. Pass `system_id`, `name`, `description`, `evidence_type`, and control/framework context.
- **`pretorin_link_evidence`** — Link an existing evidence item to a control (low-level helper).
- **`pretorin_add_control_note`** — Add a note for unresolved gaps or manual follow-up actions.

### Evidence Search
- **`pretorin_search_evidence`** — Search evidence inside the active or explicit system/framework scope. Pass `system_id` when you want to override the active scope; friendly system names are accepted.

### Review, Monitoring, and Drafting
- **`pretorin_generate_control_artifacts`** — Generate read-only AI drafts for a control narrative and evidence-gap assessment using the same Codex workflow as the CLI. Use this when the user wants a draft without writing to the platform yet.
- **`pretorin_push_monitoring_event`** — Record a monitoring event for notable findings such as scans, access reviews, or configuration changes.
- **`pretorin_update_control_status`** — Update a control implementation status when findings justify a state change.

### Batch Operations
- **`pretorin_get_controls_batch`** — Get detailed control data for many controls in one framework-scoped request. Pass `framework_id` and optionally `control_ids` (omit to get all).
- **`pretorin_create_evidence_batch`** — Create and link multiple evidence items within one system/framework scope. Pass `system_id`, `framework_id`, and `items` array.

### Workflow State & Analytics

## Campaign Workflow

For bulk compliance operations, follow this lifecycle:

1. Check what needs work: `pretorin_get_workflow_state` and `pretorin_get_pending_families`
2. Prepare the campaign: `pretorin_prepare_campaign` with the target domain (controls, policy, or scope) and mode
3. Claim items: `pretorin_claim_campaign_items` to lease items for drafting
4. Get context: `pretorin_get_campaign_item_context` for each claimed item
5. Draft and submit: `pretorin_submit_campaign_proposal` for each item
6. Review status: `pretorin_get_campaign_status` to check progress
7. Apply: `pretorin_apply_campaign` to push all proposals to the platform

## Vendor Inheritance Workflow

For controls inherited from vendors (CSPs, SaaS providers):

1. Create the vendor: `pretorin_create_vendor`
2. Upload vendor documentation: `pretorin_upload_vendor_document` (SOC 2 reports, CRMs, FedRAMP packages)
3. Set responsibility: `pretorin_set_control_responsibility` to mark controls as inherited/shared
4. Generate narratives: `pretorin_generate_inheritance_narrative` to AI-draft grounded inheritance narratives
5. Monitor staleness: `pretorin_get_stale_edges` to find controls where source narratives changed
6. Sync updates: `pretorin_sync_stale_edges` to bulk update inherited controls

## Narrative + Evidence + Notes Workflow

For any control update, follow this exact sequence:

1. Resolve the target `system_id`, `control_id`, and `framework_id`
2. Read current state first:
   - `pretorin_get_control_context`
   - `pretorin_get_narrative` or `pretorin_get_control_implementation`
   - `pretorin_search_evidence`
   - `pretorin_get_control_notes`
3. Treat existing Pretorin narratives, notes, and status fields as a starting point, not proof that a control gap exists
4. Inspect the relevant implementation in the workspace and connected MCP systems, then collect only observable facts
5. If code or connected systems show stronger implementation than the current platform record, update the narrative to reflect the observed implementation and record any remaining evidence gap separately
6. Draft updates:
   - Narrative update (include TODO placeholders for unknowns)
   - Evidence upserts
   - Gap notes for unresolved/manual items
7. Push updates:
   - `pretorin_update_narrative`
   - `pretorin_create_evidence` (dedupe on by default; pass `control_id` whenever possible so the evidence auto-links)
   - `pretorin_link_evidence` for any additional controls that should reference the same evidence item
   - `pretorin_add_control_note`

## Read-Only Draft Workflow

When the user wants drafts before any platform writes:

1. Resolve `system_id`, `control_id`, and `framework_id`
2. Read current state first:
   - `pretorin_get_control_context`
   - `pretorin_get_narrative` or `pretorin_get_control_implementation`
   - `pretorin_search_evidence`
   - `pretorin_get_control_notes`
3. Call `pretorin_generate_control_artifacts`
4. Present the generated draft as read-only output and clearly separate:
   - candidate narrative text
   - evidence gaps
   - manual follow-up actions
5. Only call write tools (`pretorin_update_narrative`, `pretorin_create_evidence`, `pretorin_add_control_note`) if the user explicitly wants to persist changes

### No-Hallucination Requirements

- Never claim an implementation detail unless it is directly observed.
- Mark uncertain or missing information as unknown.
- Existing Pretorin narratives, notes, and status values are not by themselves evidence that a gap exists.
- Before writing a narrative update or gap note, inspect the relevant implementation in the workspace and connected MCP systems.
- If observed implementation is stronger than the current platform record, update the narrative to match the observed implementation and note any remaining evidence gap separately.
- Use auditor-friendly markdown with no section headings.
- Narratives must include at least two rich markdown elements and at least one structural element (`code block`, `table`, or `list`).
- Evidence descriptions must include at least one rich markdown element.
- Rich markdown elements include: fenced code blocks, tables, lists, and links.
- Do not include markdown images until platform-side image evidence upload support is available.
- For missing narrative data, insert this exact block:

```text
[[PRETORIN_TODO]]
missing_item: <what is missing>
reason: Not observable from current workspace and connected MCP systems
required_manual_action: <what user must do on platform/integrations>
suggested_evidence_type: <policy_document|configuration|...>
[[/PRETORIN_TODO]]
```

- For each unresolved gap, add one control note in this format:

```text
Gap: <short title>
Observed: <what was verifiably found>
Missing: <what could not be verified>
Why missing: <access/system limitation>
Manual next step: <explicit user/platform action>
```

## Workflows

### Framework Selection
Help users pick the right framework for their situation. See `references/framework-selection-guide.md` for the full decision tree covering federal agencies, contractors, CSPs, and defense industrial base organizations.

### Compliance Gap Analysis
Systematically assess a codebase against a framework's controls. See `references/gap-analysis-workflow.md` for the step-by-step methodology including family prioritization, evidence collection patterns, and status assessment criteria. See `examples/gap-analysis.md` for a sample output.

### Compliance Artifact Generation
Produce structured JSON artifacts documenting how a specific control is implemented. See `references/artifact-schema.md` for the full schema and field guidelines. See `examples/artifact-example.md` for complete examples with good vs weak evidence.

### Cross-Framework Mapping
Map controls across related frameworks using the related controls returned by `pretorin_get_control_references`. See `examples/cross-framework-mapping.md` for a worked example mapping Account Management across four frameworks.

### Document Readiness Assessment
Assess documentation readiness by calling `pretorin_get_document_requirements`, then prioritize: required documents first, then documents referenced by the most controls.
